## Some Things About Me

```
My name is Karen Gong and I am a second year computer science major at UCSD. 
There's a lot that I have yet to learn about development in general but I'm
excited for the challenge. At the moment research is something I'm 
interested in.

Some things that I like:

- Dance (mostly ballet)
- Food 
- Gudetama
```
